<p>would you look at that! with your time and care you helped this plant thrive.</p>
<p>the same applies to you my friend, we’re all just plants... but with more complicated feelings and emotions. be kind with yourself like you would your plant. growth takes time, and it may seem like nothing is happening, but patience and support will get you far. </p>
<p>here, i’d like you to keep your new plant. let it be a reminder to care for yourself too.</p>
