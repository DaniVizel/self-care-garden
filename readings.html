<h2>An excerpt from</h2>
<h1>Mindfulness and Nature</h1>
<h3>William Van Gordon & Edo Shonin & Miles Richardson</h3>
<h4>Published online: 23 January 2018</h4>
<p>Interconnectedness has become an established term in the
    meditation literature. It implies that any given phenomenon
    is connected to all other phenomena. Perhaps the best way of
    appreciating how the principle of interconnectedness relates to
    our lives as human beings is through our connection with
    nature. When we breathe in, we breathe in the out-breath of
    plants, shrubs, and trees. When we breathe out, we breathe out
    the in-breath of flowers, animals, and birds. When we drink
    water, we drink the clouds, rivers, and oceans. When we eat a
    meal, we eat plants, vegetables, and fruits that have grown out
    of the earth.
</p>
<p>The notion that we exist interdependently and are connected to
     nature and all other phenomena is a beautiful idea.
    However, we would argue that it falls short of capturing the
    full depth and intimacy of our relationship with nature and the
    other phenomena that we share the universe with. The reason
    for this is that while the notion of interconnectedness helps to
    depict the symbiotic relationship that exists between humans
    and nature, it implies that one discrete and separately existing
    entity (e.g., a human being) is connected to another discrete
    and separately existing entity (e.g., nature). In other words,
    implicit within the meaning of the term interconnectedness
    is the assumption that while closely interrelated, phenomena
    are also separate from one another.
</p>
<p> From a relative standpoint, it is both possible and necessary
    to distinguish humans from nature and one phenomenon from
    another. However, because it is not possible to identify the
    "self" of a given phenomenon, there truly cannot exist a separation 
    between one thing and another thing. This is because
    as soon as we attempt to identify the origins or self of something, 
    we inevitably have to direct our search outwards to acknowledge the 
    presence of other phenomena. In other
    words, while searching for the self of something, we find
    everything else that exists except the inherently existing self
    that was the original target of our investigation. An effective
    search for self will always yield the truth that in one thing
    exists all things yet in no thing does there intrinsically exist
    anything. 
</p>
<p> We interexist with nature (and all other phenomena) to the
    extent that it is impossible to assign boundaries. Our minds
    and bodies are embedded within the natural world such that
    when we breathe in, nature breathes in with us, and when we
    breathe out, nature also breathes out. We are of the nature of
    nature; it exists in us and we exist in it. In this paper, we
    explore our connection with nature and focus on how nature
    can be used to enhance mindfulness practice, foster wellbeing,
    and cultivate insight into the self, reality, and the present 
    moment more generally.
